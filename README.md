### Cograph generator:
Given the number of nodes n, generates all cotrees that correspond to all cographs with n nodes. The algorithm generates one by one every cotree with n nodes, and for each cotree is generated by using its previous cotree. The time to construct the first cotree is O(n) and the time spent between two consecutive outputs is O(n). Hence, the overall complexity of the algorithm is O(n*Mn) , where n is the number of nodes and Mn is the total number of cographs with n nodes.  For each n, the number of cographs with n nodes can be found  in the following link: https://oeis.org/A000084
